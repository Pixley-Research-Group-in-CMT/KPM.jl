I'm drafting a manuscript for submission to JOSS (https://joss.theoj.org) for our Julia package (https://github.com/Pixley-Research-Group-in-CMT/KPM.jl). This package use the kernel polynomial method to compute the spectrum (DOS and local DOS) for tight-binding models, can also compute the transport and optical responses. We used it in multiply papers (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023325), (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014201), (https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03149). Based on the readme.md file in the repo and the papers, could you please draft a JOSS manuscript with 4 sections: Summary, Statement of need, software design and research impact statement?
